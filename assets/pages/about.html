        Our Federated Learning System Framework is designed to enhance the privacy, security, and resilience of machine learning models in distributed environments. 
      </p>
    </br>
      By integrating four core components—Attack Detection & Resilience, Privacy Preservation, Secure Aggregation, and Secure C2 Communication—this framework ensures the integrity of the learning process, protects sensitive data, and secures communication between clients and the server. With advanced techniques like anomaly detection, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and threshold cryptography, the system provides robust solutions against adversarial attacks, privacy breaches, and data exposure risks, making it ideal for industrial IoT applications and other privacy-sensitive use cases.
